# Why Is There No Leaderboard
A stopgap plugin that clarifies why leaderboards on custom songs are not supported and allows the user to download one.

Currently only ScoreSaber and BeatLeader are supported, but if any other Beat Saber leaderboard services want to be included while this is used as a solution feel free to PR.
